abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The chapter describes a small language whose constructions reflect simple operational ideas; the meaning of these constructions is presented by means of structured operational semantics. Congruence relation is interpreted as equality of processes. The essence of the congruence is that it is built upon the idea of observing a process, which is taken to mean communicating with it. The idea is that the processes are equal if they are indistinguishable in any experiment based upon observation. Observation equivalence is characterized by a simple modal logic.},

abstract = {Bisimulation provides structural conditions to characterize indistinguishability from an exter-nal observer between nodes on labeled graphs. It is a fundamental notion used in many areas, such as verification, graph-structured databases, and constraint satisfaction. However, several current applications use graphs where nodes also contain data (the so called " data graphs "), and where ob-servers can test for equality or inequality of data values (e.g., asking the attribute 'name' of a node to be different from that of all its neighbors). The present work constitutes a first investigation of " data aware " bisimulations on data graphs. We study the problem of computing such bisimulations, based on the observational indistinguishability for XPath —a language that extends modal logics like PDL with tests for data equality— with and without transitive closure operators. We show that in general the problem is PSPACE-complete, but identify several restrictions that yield better complexity bounds (CO-NP, PTIME) by controlling suitable parameters of the problem, namely the amount of non-locality allowed, and the class of models considered (graphs, DAGs, trees). In particular, this analysis yields a hierarchy of tractable fragments.},

abstract = {Background: Few studies had examined whether specific patient variables or performance on functional testing can predict length of stay (LOS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Such tools would enable providers to minimize prolonged LOS by planning appropriate discharge dispositions preoperatively. Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 patients undergoing a THA through an anterior (n = 40), posterior (n = 40), or lateral (n = 40) approach. Patients performed a timed up-and-go (TUG) test preoperatively to determine if it was predictive of hospital LOS after THA. Other variables of interest included patient age, body mass index, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, mean procedure time, and time spent in the postanesthetic care unit. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which variables predicted LOS greater than 48 hours, which is our institution's target time to discharge. Results: The TUG test was predictive of LOS beyond 48 hours. For every 5-second interval increase in TUG time, patients were twice as likely to stay in hospital beyond 48 hours (odds ratio [OR] = 2.02, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-4.01, P = .043). Patient age (OR = 0.97, 95{\%} CI = 0.90-1.05, P = .46), body mass index (OR = 1.01, 95{\%} CI = 0.86-1.18, P = .90), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR = 1.29, 95{\%} CI = 0.68-2.44, P = .44), mean procedure time (OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 0.97-1.14, P = .27), and mean time in the postanesthetic care unit (OR = 1.00, 95{\%} CI = 0.99-1.00, P = .94) were not predictive of increased LOS. Conclusion: The TUG test was predictive of hospital LOS after THA. It is a simple functional test that can be used to assist with discharge planning preoperatively to minimize extended hospital stays.},

abstract = {2nd corr. ed. Originally published: Academic Press, 1978 in series: Pure and applied mathematics ; vol. 79. This introduction to modern set theory covers all aspects of its two main general areas: classical set theory including large cardinals, infinitary combinatorics, desriptive set theory, and independence proofs starting with Goedel's proof around 1938 followed by Cohen's proof in 1963, whereby Cohen's method of forcing probably had a greater influence on mathematics. The author's primary emphasis is on forcing and large cardinals (on which he has collected an enormous amount of material which had previously been available only through scattered journal articles or private communication) but there is a substantial discussion of descriptive set theory and infinitary combinatorics as well. The author's presentation is very well-organized and carefully worked out and has become a standard reference.

abstract = {Background: Few studies had examined whether specific patient variables or performance on functional testing can predict length of stay (LOS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Such tools would enable providers to minimize prolonged LOS by planning appropriate discharge dispositions preoperatively. Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 patients undergoing a THA through an anterior (n = 40), posterior (n = 40), or lateral (n = 40) approach. Patients performed a timed up-and-go (TUG) test preoperatively to determine if it was predictive of hospital LOS after THA. Other variables of interest included patient age, body mass index, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, mean procedure time, and time spent in the postanesthetic care unit. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which variables predicted LOS greater than 48 hours, which is our institution's target time to discharge. Results: The TUG test was predictive of LOS beyond 48 hours. For every 5-second interval increase in TUG time, patients were twice as likely to stay in hospital beyond 48 hours (odds ratio [OR] = 2.02, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-4.01, P = .043). Patient age (OR = 0.97, 95{\%} CI = 0.90-1.05, P = .46), body mass index (OR = 1.01, 95{\%} CI = 0.86-1.18, P = .90), Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR = 1.29, 95{\%} CI = 0.68-2.44, P = .44), mean procedure time (OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 0.97-1.14, P = .27), and mean time in the postanesthetic care unit (OR = 1.00, 95{\%} CI = 0.99-1.00, P = .94) were not predictive of increased LOS. Conclusion: The TUG test was predictive of hospital LOS after THA. It is a simple functional test that can be used to assist with discharge planning preoperatively to minimize extended hospital stays.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the supplementation of wheat semolina (WS) with naked barley flour (BF) in order to produce macaroni with considerable fiber content, associated with lowered plasma cholesterol and postprandial serum glucose and insulin responses, good sensory properties, good cooking quality and beneficial values for human suffer from higher glucose in blood, higher cholesterol or coronary diseases. Macaroni were produced made by blending of local semolina (LS) or imported semolina (IS) as follows: 100{\%} WS, 10{\%} BF+90{\%} WS, 20{\%} BF+80{\%} WS, 30{\%} BF+70{\%} WS and 40{\%} BF+60{\%} WS. Proximate chemical composition, color parameters, sensory evaluation and cooking quality were measured and scanning electron microscope. Increasing the level of BF replacement led to increasing the ash, ether extract, and total crude fiber in the products. This was true for both macaroni done from imported or local semolina. Enrichment macaroni dough by BF lowered the percentages of increasing in cooking weight (CW) and cooking volume (CV) and raised the rate of cooking loss (CL) using LS. Similar trends were detected with imported semolina but in different degrees. A negative response was found in lightness (L*) by mixing BF in different rates. Redness (a*) values for local semolina macaroni were reversely responded. The increment in this factor exceeded in macaroni produced from IS than this produced from LS. Yellowness (b*) slightly affected in the case of IS and sharply depressed in LS macaroni. Replacing 20{\%} of BF instead of LS led to lower the increasing weight (180{\%}) and volume increasing {\%} (175 {\%}) to be 165 and 153, meanwhile, when the {\%} of BF increase to be 40{\%}, these two quality parameters sharply depressed to be 128 and 132{\%}, respectively, compare to the control treatment. Nevertheless, the increasing of BF {\%} in the blends raised the cooking loss from 10{\%} in the control to be 11.5{\%} in the blend contained 20{\%} and to 16{\%} in the blend contains 40{\%} BF. Mixing BF with IS induced similar trends (but in different degrees) of those with the LS. The depression in all sensory test characters did not exceeded than 11{\%} with IS when Bf blended in the rate of 20{\%}. All sensory parameters sharply deceased by replacement of 40{\%} BF in the blends either with IS or LS. Data could be led to conclude the possibility of producing macaroni relatively higher in fiber and $\beta$- glucan without considerable bad effects on its cooking quality and sensory properties and has many benefits for health of diabetes, high cholesterol patients and hart diseases.},

As far as complexity is concerned, we show among other results that while the problem of deciding satisfiability of an S5 formula with one knower is NP-complete, the problem for many knowers is PSPACE-complete. Adding an implicit knowledge operator does not change the complexity substantially, but once a common knowledge operator is added to the language, the problem becomes complete for exponential time.},

@book{Mohri2013,
abstract = {In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for {\$}\backslasheps{\$} training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across nodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model. Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol that uses {\$}O(d{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication to classify distributed data in arbitrary dimension {\$}d{\$}, {\$}\backslasheps{\$}-optimally. This readily extends to classification over {\$}k{\$} nodes with {\$}O(kd{\^{}}2 \backslashlog{\{}1/\backslasheps{\}}){\$} words of communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical results. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.},

In this paper, we show that certain semantic operators for propositional logic programs can be computed by feedforward connectionist networks, and that the same semantic operators for first-order normal logic programs can be approximated by feedforward connectionist networks. Turning the networks into recurrent ones allows one also to approximate the models associated with the semantic operators. Our methods depend on a well-known theorem of Funahashi, and necessitate the study of when Funahashi's theorem can be applied, and also the study of what means of approximation are appropriate and significant."

However, there are few results of learning relations using neuro-symbolic learning. This paper presents the system PAN, which can learn relations. The inputs to PAN are one or more atoms, representing the conditions of a logic rule, and the output is the conclusion of the rule. The symbolic inputs may include functional terms of arbitrary depth and arity, and the output may include terms constructed from the input functors. Symbolic inputs are encoded as an integer using an invertible encoding function, which is used in reverse to extract the output terms. The main advance of this system is a convention to allow construction of Artificial Neural Networks able to learn rules with the same power of expression as first order definite clauses. The system is tested on three examples and the results are discussed.},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.
